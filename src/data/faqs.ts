    question: "How does selling my house for cash work?",
    answer: "It's simple. You contact us with your property details, we schedule a quick visit or virtual walkthrough, and within 24-48 hours you'll receive a fair, no-obligation cash offer. If you accept, you choose your closing date and we handle all the paperwork. You get paid at closing."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to make repairs before selling?",
    answer: "No. We buy houses in any condition — as-is. Whether your home needs minor cosmetic updates or major repairs, we'll make you an offer. You don't need to spend time or money fixing anything."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any fees or commissions?",
    answer: "None. Unlike selling with a real estate agent, you pay zero commissions and zero fees when you sell to us. The offer we make is the amount you receive at closing (minus any existing mortgage payoff)."
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can you close?",
    answer: "We can close in as little as 7-14 days if you need to move fast. However, we're flexible — if you need more time, we can close on your schedule. You pick the date that works best for you."
  },
  {
    question: "Will you buy my house if it's in probate?",
    answer: "Yes. We regularly work with families dealing with inherited properties and probate situations. We understand the process and can guide you through it while making a fair offer on the property."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you buy my house if I have tenants?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We buy tenant-occupied properties all the time. You don't need to deal with evictions or wait for leases to end. We'll handle the tenants after closing."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm behind on payments or facing foreclosure?",
    answer: "We can often help. Selling for cash can allow you to pay off your mortgage and avoid foreclosure, protecting your credit. Contact us as soon as possible so we can discuss your options."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you determine your offer price?",
    answer: "We look at your home's location, condition, size, and recent comparable sales in your area. Our goal is to make a fair offer that works for both of us. We're transparent about how we arrive at our numbers."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there any obligation if I get an offer?",
    answer: "None whatsoever. Our cash offers are completely no-obligation. If you decide not to sell, that's perfectly fine. There's no pressure and no hard feelings."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you buy all types of properties?",
    answer: "We buy single-family homes, duplexes, townhomes, condos, and sometimes land. Whether it's your primary residence, a rental property, or an inherited home, we're interested."
  },
  {
    question: "What areas do you serve?",
    answer: "We focus on Central Texas, including Killeen, Harker Heights, Temple, Belton, Copperas Cove, Waco, and surrounding communities. If you're in the area, reach out — we'd love to help."
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I sell to you instead of listing with an agent?",
    answer: "Selling to us means speed, certainty, and convenience. No showings, no repairs, no waiting for buyer financing to fall through. You get a guaranteed cash offer and close on your timeline. It's ideal if you need to sell quickly or want to avoid the hassle of a traditional sale."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens at closing?",
    answer: "Closing is handled by a local title company. You'll sign the paperwork, the title transfers, and you receive your funds — often via wire transfer or cashier's check the same day. We make it as smooth as possible."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I sell if I still owe money on my mortgage?",
    answer: "Yes. Most homeowners still have a mortgage when they sell. At closing, your mortgage balance is paid off from the sale proceeds, and you receive the remaining amount."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer: "Just fill out our quick form or give us a call at (254) 498-6025. Tell us about your property, and we'll take it from there. It only takes a few minutes, and there's no obligation."
